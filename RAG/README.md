# Create a generative AI app that uses your own data
## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique used to build applications that integrate data from custom data sources into a prompt for a generative AI model. RAG is a commonly used pattern for developing generative AI apps - chat-based applications that use a language model to interpret inputs and generate appropriate responses.
